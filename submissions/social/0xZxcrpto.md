# Shoutout Board

This is a small vApp idea built on top of Soundness.

The purpose is very simple: let people leave short public messages ("shoutouts") that stay on-chain.  
I wanted something like a community wall or a bulletin board, but in a decentralized way.

### Why this?
Sometimes we just want to say hello, share a small note, or leave a message that won’t get lost.  
This feels like a fun and lightweight use case to try out the Soundness layer.

### How it works (basic idea)
- Connect your wallet
- Write a short message (max 200 characters)
- The message gets stored and can be read by anyone

### Possible next steps
Later this can be extended with reactions, simple tipping, or message filters.  
For now, it’s just a minimal on-chain message board.
